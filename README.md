# Flight Delay/Cancellation Prediction ML  

## Project Objective  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting airline flight delays and cancellations. By leveraging historical flight data, we aim to uncover key insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and use Machine Learning models to predict delays based on flight-specific features.
